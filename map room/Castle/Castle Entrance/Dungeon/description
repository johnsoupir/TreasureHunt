You are standing in the dungeon. It's dark and damp down here. The torchlight
flickers across the walls. Why are they still burning anyway?
There's all kinds of stuff down here. Weird stuff.
There's a jail cell to your left. I skeleton sits on the bed, watching you.
On the right there is what looks like a bed of nails. I'm sure it's just for decoration, right?
There is a storeroom to the side, and a portal ahead of you. It's black as night, and it's 
making a weird demonic sound. I'd stay away if I were you. 
There's also a strange looking thing in the corner that looks like a giant rat trap.
