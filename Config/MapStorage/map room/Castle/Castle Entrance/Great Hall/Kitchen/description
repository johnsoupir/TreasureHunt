You are standing in the Kitchen. You're kind of hungry, so you grab a slice of bread
that's sitting on a table. It's rock hard, probably because it's older than you are.
There are a lot of pots and pans hanging from the ceiling. You're going to have to be
careful not to hit your head.
There's a broom closet in the corner and lots of ovens.
