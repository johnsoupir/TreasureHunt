You are standing in the great hall. Huge arches stretch 
across the ceiling far above you.

There is are a lot of rooms here.

An armory is to your left. It's probably full of all kinds of dangerous weapons.
There's a chapel and a kitchen long the right wall. A storeroom too.
The throne room is all the way in the back.

There were some coins on th floor too. Huh.
